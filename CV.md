###  Important
 As I lived in a foreign country with an exposure to  a variety of languages , I developed multilingual, multicultural skills which are presently underutilised no matter how much freelance work I have . I  was advised  by a friend of mine , who is a  successful coder , to start learning front-end development. I expect  coding  to perfectly combine with my  language skills and  give  me  a sense of fulfillment .
